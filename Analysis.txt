	  is expected to be offset partly by a moderate pick-up in other large economies, including India.
	* The domestic chemical industry is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 9% to touch US$ 304 Billion by FY 2024-25 from US$ 163 Billion in FY 2017-18 according to the India Chem Strategy Report by FICCI.

	* A manufacturing company is constantly in need of a significant amount of power and electricity in its processes of manufacturing and waste management. As nonconventional energy is presently unfeasible and alternative fuels

NOTE : Phenol is a versatile industrial organic chemical and it is used to produce a wide variety of chemical intermediates including bis-phenol-A, phenolic resins, cyclohexanone etc. It is consumed
in a large range of end-use segments such as laminates, automobile, foundry, paints, rubber, surfactants, pharma, and agro-chemicals, among others. On the other hand, Acetone
is predominantly used in the production of pharmaceuticals apart from its significant applications in paints, adhesives, and thinners among others. Acetone, as we know, is a co-product of
the phenol manufacturing process.
